- **Clean Architecture:** Our codebase is organized using Clean Architecture principles, making it modular and easy to understand, develop, and maintain.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Enhancing performance and scalability by separating read and write operations.

**Frontend:**
The user interface is crafted using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, providing a smooth and intuitive experience for our users.
